## Local Development

To develop this theme locally, you can link it to a Hugo site (like the [academy starter template](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-example)) using a `replace` directive in the site's `go.mod` file.

1.  **Directory Setup**

    Ensure you have cloned both this theme repository and your Hugo site repository into the same parent directory. Your folder structure should look like this:
    ```
    my-hugo-projects/
    ├── academy-example/     <-- Your content project
    └── hugo-academy-theme/  <-- This theme project
    ```

2.  **Modify `go.mod`**

    In your site's (`academy-example/`) `go.mod` file, add the following `replace` directive to point to your local theme folder:
    ```go
    replace github.com/layer5io/academy-theme => ../hugo-academy-theme
    ```

3.  **Run the Server**
    Now, when you run `make site` from within your site's directory, Hugo will use your local theme files instead of fetching the remote module, allowing you to see your changes live.
